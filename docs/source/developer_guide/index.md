# Developer Guide

cuSpatial has two main components: the cuSpatial Python package and the `libcuspatial` C++ library,
referred to as `cuspatial` and `libcuspatial` respectively in this documentation. This page
discusses the design of `cuspatial`. For information on `libcuspatial`, see the [libcuspatial
developer guide](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/libcuspatial/stable/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.html)
and [C++ API reference](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/libcuspatial/stable/).
